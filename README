The scripts provided by the Qt-builds project are designed for building Qt and Qt-Creator with MinGW compiler from MinGW-builds[2] project.

The scripts are distributed under the 'BSD 3' license[1].

In order to use the scripts provided by the Qt-builds project it is needed:

1. Windows

2. Install MSYS:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds/files/external-binary-packages/
  Recommended version is rev9 or higher.

3. Get the scripts into '<msys root>/home/<user>/Qt-builds':
  "cd && git clone git://github.com/Alexpux/Qt-builds.git"

4. In the MSYS file structure delete the '/MinGW' directory.

5. Delete the paths pointing to any preinstalled MinGW from the 'PATH' environment variable.

6. Go into the Qt-builds root directory.
  "cd && cd Qt-builds"

7. Build script has next parameters:
  The '--buildroot=<path>' option specifies to the script to use '<path>' as build directory.
    By default used <SCRIPTS_DIR>/work.
  The '--install-top=<path>' option specifies to the script to use '<path>' as top installation directory.
    By default used "C:/QtSDK" directory.
  The '--opengl-desktop' option specifies to the script to build Qt with '-opengl desktop' option.
    Affected only Qt-5.x versions. By default used '-angle' option.
  The '--qt-version=<version>' option specifies which version of Qt to build.
    If not specified the default (hardcoded in script) version is builded.
  The '--build-python' specifies to the script to build Python instead using prebuilded Python from MinGW-builds.
  The '--no-qtcreator' specifies to the script doesn't build Qt-Creator.
  The '--static-qt' specifies to build Qt as static libraries with all dependencies as static.
    For now Qt5 static build has many restrictions and it can't be build with Webkit, ANGLE and ICU.
  The '--version' option print the version of Qt-builds script.
  For all available options please run: "./buildall --help"

8. Run:
  "./buildall x32" - for building 32-bit Qt
  "./buildall x64" - for building 64-bit Qt
  "./buildall x32 x64" - for building both 32 and 64 bits Qt

By default Qt installing in "C:/QtSDK/Qt{32,64}-<version>" and 3rdparty libraries in "C:/QtSDK/ported{32,64}".
You may change install location by pass "--install-top=$DIRECTORY" to build script.

For example:
./buildall --install-top=C:/SDK x32
building 32-bit Qt and installing Qt into C:/SDK/Qt32-<version>.
