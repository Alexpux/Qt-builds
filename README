The scripts provided by the Qt-builds project are designed for building Qt-5.x with MinGW compiler.

The scripts are distributed under the 'BSD 3' license[1].

In order to use the scripts provided by the Qt-builds project it is needed:

1. Windows

2. Install MSYS:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbuilds/files/external-binary-packages/

3. Get the scripts into '<msys root>/home/<user>/Qt-builds':
  "cd && git clone git://github.com/Alexpux/Qt-builds.git"

4. In the MSYS file structure delete the '/MinGW' directory.

5. Delete the paths pointing to any preinstalled MinGW from the 'PATH' environment variable.

6. Go into the Qt-builds root directory.
  "cd && cd Qt-builds"

7. Run:
  "./buildall x32" - for building 32-bit Qt
  "./buildall x64" - for building 64-bit Qt
  "./buildall x32 x64" - for building both 32 and 64 bits Qt

By default Qt installing in "C:/SDK/Qt5-x{32,64}" and 3rdparty libraries in "C:/SDK/ported-x{32,64}".
You may change install location by pass "--install-top=$DIRECTORY" to build script.

For example:
./buildall --install-top=C:/QtSDK x32
building 32-bit Qt and installing Qt into C:/QtSDK/Qt5-x32.
